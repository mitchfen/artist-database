### Overview

I go to a lot of concerts, and was having trouble keeping track of who I have/haven't seen. I need a solution that allows me to select all the artists I have seen at a given venue, year, etc.  

Excel and Excel macros are alright, but  SQLite is better for performing queries.  
SQLite is also more relevant to my future interests and this project was a good opportunity to learn how to build a GUI in Python.

The program has an alternative CLI and works on Windows 10 and Linux.

### Running the program

Execute `python .\src\main.py` or download the release.
