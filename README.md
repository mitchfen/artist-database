# Concert tracker

### Overview
I go to a lot of concerts, and was having trouble keeping track of who I have/haven't seen. I wanted a solution that allows me to select all the artists I have seen at a given venue, year, etc. 
Excel and Excel macros are alright, but SQLite is better for performing queries.  

This project was a good opportunity to learn how to build a GUI in Python.

### Running the program
